Most of network devices uses dynamic routing with IGP (OSPF / IS-IS) and BGP protocol. Multiple Vendors provide simple commands to isolate network device gracefully. IGP-Based Isolation IGPs such as OSPF, IS-IS,operate within an autonomous system (AS). Device isolation can be achieved by: Max-metric: Advertise higher metrics on all interfaces to make the device less preferred for transit traffic; command syntax may differ by vendor. Overload Bit (IS-IS): Set the overload bit to signal other routers to avoid using this device for transit traffic. Route Filters: Apply filters at area boundaries to control which prefixes are advertised. Example (OSPF): router ospf ABC max-metric Example (ISIS): router isis ABC set-overload-bit BGP-Based Isolation BGP is used for inter-AS routing and provides advanced isolation mechanisms: Graceful-maintenance: Limit route visibility between devices or groups. Graceful-shutdown: Control which routes are advertised or accepted between peers. Communities and Policies: Tag routes for selective propagation or restriction. Example (BGP Prefix Filtering): ip prefix-list BLOCKED seq 5 deny 192.168.100.0/24 ip prefix-list BLOCKED seq 10 permit 0.0.0.0/0 le 32 router bgp 65001 neighbor 10.1.1.2 prefix-list BLOCKED out Use Cases Multi-Tenant Networks: Isolate customer devices using VRFs and route policies. Security Zones: Restrict communication between sensitive and general-purpose devices. Testing Environments: Prevent test devices from affecting production traffic. Conclusion Combining IGP and BGP techniques enables robust device isolation, enhancing security and network manageability. Proper configuration of areas, route filters, and policies is critical for effective isolation.","title":"Device Isolation"},{"location":"posts/device-isolation.html#network-device-isolation","text":"Network device needs to be isolated in operations for maintenance , hardware or software upgrades.
